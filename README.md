## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

You can download Node.js and npm from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mediku.git
   cd mediku
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - You need to create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
     ```

4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Project
To run the project locally:
1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will compile your code and launch the project on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Login to access different dashboards**:
   - **Admin**: You can log in with the following credentials:
     - **Email**: `admin@example.com`
     - **Password**: `admin123`
   - The dashboard will redirect you to the admin panel if the login is successful.

3. **User Dashboard**: After login, users will be redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role (currently only admin).

## Accessing Different Dashboards
1. **Login Page**: To access the application, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2. **Login Form**:
   - Enter your email and password.
   - Click on `Log In`.

3. **Redirection**:
   - If logged in as `admin`, you will be redirected to the `admin-dashboard.html`.
   - Users with other roles will be redirected to their respective dashboards (to be implemented).
